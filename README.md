# hypixel_guild_exp
 
**THIS PROJECT CURRENTLY ABANDONED** (anyway it works, i think)

This program is made for Guild Masters and Helpers. It will help you see your statistics on the Hypixel Server of each individual member.


In order to find out your Hypixel API TOKEN, you need to go to the game, open a chat and write the command: **/api new**
